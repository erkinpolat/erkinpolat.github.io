							<h2>Flappy Bird with Q-Learning</h2>

							<p><a href="https://github.com/erkinpolat/Reinforcement-Learning/tree/main/flappy_bird" target="_blank">Link to the GitHub</a></p>

							<p style="color: #808080">
								For this project, I implemented a Q-Learning agent that is trained to play Flappy Bird. To do this I first built the game environment in Pygame. For this I used a tutorial as a reference and rewrote the code so that it's object oriented and much cleaner. I then implemented the q-learning algorithm and trained it.
								<br>
								The main struggle with implementing the q-learning algorithm in a game like Flappy Bird is that the state space is continuous and even if it is translated into a discrete space, the state space end up being very big. To simplify the state space I used the vertical and horizontal distances to the next obstacle as the two parameters that define the state. In the end the bird learned how to fly and was able to go through a couple of obstacles. In the future, I'll be implementing other Reinforcement Learning methods such as Deep Q-Learning and Imitation Learning to see how the performance will improve.
